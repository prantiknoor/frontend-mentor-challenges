## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The important challenges was **Responsivness**, **Dropdown** & **Navbar**. Recently I completed a course called [Build a space travel website](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) by *Kevin Powell* in *Scrimba*. Where I learned all of these. I have practiced those concepts & knowledge. Although I have changed many properties/values, added new.

I also used a browser extention to make my site **Pixel Perfect**.


### Continued development

- Responsive Design
- Accessibility

### Useful resources
- [Build a space travel website](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - Bring a Frontend Mentor design to life and create your own design system while building a multi-page space travel website with Kevin Powell as your guide.
- [Responsive Web Design - freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) - This is an amazing course which helped me finally understand HTML & CSS very well. I'd recommend it to anyone new in web development
