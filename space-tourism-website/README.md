## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I made this project as a part of my learning journey. The instructor of [the course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) was @Kevin-Powell. I learned many many things. As a summury:

- CSS Design System
- Better use of CSS custom properties
- CSS Reset
- Utility classes
- Mobile first workflow
- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- Code reusing, etc.

The most cool thing is that, tab functionality. (made for one, work for all)

### Continued development

By doing this project, I learn many things, tips. Now I will have to make work these on other project.
