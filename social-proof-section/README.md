## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about **Responsive Design** and **Pixel Perfect Design**.

I used CSS Custom properties.

```css
:root {
  /* colors */
  --clr-dark: 300 43% 22%;
  --clr-light: 0 0% 100%;
  --clr-accent: 333 80% 67%;

  --clr-s-dark: 303 10% 53%;
  --clr-s-light: 300 24% 96%;

  /* font sizes */
  --fs-800: 2.375rem;
  --fs-500: 1.125rem;
  --fs-400: 1rem;

  /* font families */
  --ff-sans-serif: "League Spartan", sans-serif;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 64rem) {
  :root {
    --fs-800: 3.375rem;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

- Responsive design.
- JavaScript
- Sass

### Useful resources
